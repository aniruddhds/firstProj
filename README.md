Just a basic website with basic features. The interesting part is that CSS and JS were implemented to give the website some more features.

This is a sandbox to test all kinds of new features and learn JavaScript, perhaps even more as required.
The new feature-filled sandbox web pages will be implemented into the main 'website.html' as links to those pages.

The Current Website Lives Here: https://aniruddhds.github.io/firstProj/website.html
